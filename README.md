# ChatGem
If wondering why the files are called chatgenie that was our original name in early development stages sadly there's already a company called Chatgenie.

If you are wondering ChatGem is a new chatbot that me and some friends are working on there are many commands that we have made so far there's a  list on my replit page right here https://replit.com/@zspocter15/ChatGem?v=1#index.html but I will go over them quickly (ping-pong, hi, hey, hello, you are so adjective, and whopper. We also have other features such as credits resetting the chat and math genie. Thanks for taking the time to check out our project here's a reward, go to MathGem, and then on your keyboard click these buttons. Up arrow x2 Down arrow x2 it's an easter egg that we made for you:-) 
postscript please don't steal my API key.
